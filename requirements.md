# Quacks Slack Currency

## Vision

Quack is a digital currency built on the Etheruem ERC-20 standard. It will be deployed to an Ethereum testnet and used as a workspace specific currency in slack. This will allow members of the workspace to show appreciation for one another by tipping, use the coins to show support for proposals and hopefully purchased digital artwork created by other members. This will incentivize acts of appreciation, encourage camaraderie and make slack more fun and interactive.  


## Scope

### IN
The front end of our application will be comprised of a set of slack interfaces accessed with a simple slash command in the text input. From this menu, holders of the coin will be able to:
* transfer coins to another member in the workspace
* mint new coins that will be distributed to all current holders
* burn coins to show support for a proposal
* draft a proposal for a vote
* withdraw coins into a crytocurrency wallet such as meta-mask

### OUT
These features will not be included.
* our currency will not be deployed to the ethereum mainnet and will not be worth real money
* users will never have to pay real money
* our currency won't be mined

### MVP
Our app will provide a way to exchange our proprietary digital currency using slack. All transactions will be recorded on the blockchain via a smnart contract deployed to a testnet. This currency will be functional and can inflate. Anything that costs coins will adjust according to inflation.
