# Quack Slack App & Ethereum Token

## What is Quack?

Quack is a digital currency built on the the Etheruem ERC-20 standard. It will be deployed to an Ethereum testnet and used as a workspace specific currency in Slack.

## What is the purpose of Quack?

Quack Slack App will allow members of the workspace to show appreciation for one another by tipping, use the coins to show support for proposals and hopefully purchase digital artwork created by other members. This will incentivize acts of appreciation, encourage camaraderie and make Slack more fun and interactive.
